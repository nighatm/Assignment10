            <p class="pText">The history of cake dates back to ancient times. The first cakes were very different from
                what we eat today. They were more bread-like and sweetened with honey.</p>

            <p class="pText">Cake isn’t just for celebrations. In fact, the best cakes are everyday treats that you bake
                and frost (if necessary) in the same pan. That’s likely why simple pumpkin cakes, dump cakes, and the humble
                Gooey Butter Cake were some of Kitchn’s most popular cake recipes</p>
